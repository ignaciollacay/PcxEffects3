**PcxEffects3.1** is a [Unity] project where I automated the process of importing and animating point clouds (imported via [Pcx]) as a VFX source, forked from [Keijiro's PcxEffects3](https://github.com/keijiro/PcxEffects3)

[Unity]: https://unity3d.com
[Pcx]: https://github.com/keijiro/Pcx

The added scripts, point cloud data and other assets were created by me.
